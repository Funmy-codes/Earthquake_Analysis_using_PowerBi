# Earthquake Data Visualizations ðŸ“Š

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global earthquake data using Power BI. The data includes information on the magnitude, depth, and distribution of earthquakes by continent, country, and region. The aim is to help users explore patterns and trends in seismic activities worldwide.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following key attributes:
-   Magnitude by Continent: Visualization of earthquake magnitudes across different continents.
-   Depth Analysis: Breakdown of earthquake depth by location, continent, and title (specific events).
-   Monthly Earthquake Trends: Insights into the monthly distribution of earthquakes over time.
-   Estimated Intensity by Continent: Estimation of earthquake intensity by continent.
-   Gap by Magnitude Type: Analysis of gaps in earthquake data based on magnitude types.
   
## Visualizations Included

The project includes the following visualizations:

1. Magnitude by Continent: Displays earthquake magnitudes across continents like Asia, South America, and North America.
2. Distribution by Country: Shows earthquake occurrences across different countries such as Afghanistan, Algeria, and Antarctica.
3. Sum of Depth by Location: Highlights the depth of earthquakes in different regions like Fiji, Okhotsk, and Levu.
4. Magnitude and Depth over Time: Visualizes trends over the years, showing how magnitudes and depths have changed from 2010 to 2020.
5. Gap by Magnitude Type: A detailed look at the different types of earthquake magnitudes (mww, mwc, mwb, etc.).
   
## Usage
The visualizations in this repository can be used to:
- Understand the global and regional trends of Earthquake_Analysis.
- Analyze the differences in cases, recoveries, and fatalities across countries and regions.
- Gain insights into how different regions were impacted and the effectiveness of recovery efforts.

## How to View
You can view the visualizations by downloading the PDF file from this repository and opening it with any standard PDF viewer.

## Dataset Source
The data used for these visualizations were sourced from the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/), with updates from various global health agencies.
