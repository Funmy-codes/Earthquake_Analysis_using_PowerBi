# Earthquake Data Visualizations ðŸ“Š

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global earthquake data using Power BI. The data includes information on the magnitude, depth, and distribution of earthquakes by continent, country, and region. The aim is to help users explore patterns and trends in seismic activities worldwide.


## Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following key attributes:
Magnitude by Continent: Visualization of earthquake magnitudes across different continents.
Depth Analysis: Breakdown of earthquake depth by location, continent, and title (specific events).
Monthly Earthquake Trends: Insights into the monthly distribution of earthquakes over time.
Estimated Intensity by Continent: Estimation of earthquake intensity by continent.
Gap by Magnitude Type: Analysis of gaps in earthquake data based on magnitude types.
## Visualizations Included
The PDF file contains several visualizations that provide a comprehensive overview of the Earthquake_Analysis pandemic:

1. *Global Overview:*
   - Total confirmed cases, total active cases, total recovered, and total deaths for all regions globally.
   
2. *USA-specific Overview:*
   - Focused analysis on the spread, impact, and trends of Earthquake_Analysis in the USA.
   
## Usage
The visualizations in this repository can be used to:
- Understand the global and regional trends of Earthquake_Analysis.
- Analyze the differences in cases, recoveries, and fatalities across countries and regions.
- Gain insights into how different regions were impacted and the effectiveness of recovery efforts.

## How to View
You can view the visualizations by downloading the PDF file from this repository and opening it with any standard PDF viewer.

## Dataset Source
The data used for these visualizations were sourced from the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/), with updates from various global health agencies.
